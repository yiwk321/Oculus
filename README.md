### Description
This is an Oculus VR hitscan aim trainer.

After the game starts, targets will be spawned around the player at random locations. Targets will move at random speed in one of three patterns: horizontal, vertical, and forward/backward. There will be at most 20 targets at any given time. If a target is not hit within 30 seconds, it will destroy itself. 

The player are spawned at the middle of the scene, and can freely teleport and are free to turn their perspective. Every second, the game spawns a target sphere at random location around the player. The player can aim using the right controller and fire by pressing the trigger. A line shoot from the right controller indicating the direction it is point at. If the player hits a target, the target will be destroyed and the player will get a point. 

There is a score board in the game that will always be at the top left corner of the screen which shows the score of the player.
